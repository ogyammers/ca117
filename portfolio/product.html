        <div class="sections">
          <h2>Brain Games</h2>
          <p>One major aspect of this app are the inclusion of in-app games and puzzles. Across the entire app there will be a total of twelve memory testing games, all researched and proven to help the memory of dementia patients. These games are divided into four main categories Household Activities, Games and Puzzles, Brain Training Games and Physical Activities. This leaves its user with a wide range of games to partake in facilitating for every user’s needs.<br><br>

      <section id="Blogging Section" class="container-content">
        <div class="sections">
          <h2>Blogging Section</h2>
          <p>Another useful aspect of this app is the addition of the blogging section allowing its users to write daily or even hourly blogs on events throughout their day. These blogs will not only prove useful for their writers as they can look back and see what they had previously completed in the weeks just past, but also their can be an option when creating the app to send these blogs to specific emails. This allows family members who maybe can’t always be there for their friend or family member to connect and feel attached to its user and informs them if they should or shouldn’t be concerned for their wellbeing. Overall, this feature should revolutionise the life of its users for the better and in a recently published survey 88% of people agreed with us. <br><br>

This eliminates all confusion for its user when it comes to taking their pills. <br><br>

          <h2>Our Market Research</h2>
          <p>Throughout our design and prototype period of this app we conducted endless research on what would be the best features to include into such an app to help dementia patients in their everyday tasks and errands. Our app is a combination and blend of all this research to create an easy to use and navigate app. We used resources such as the internet, books and even newspapers dating back as far as 2013 in the research of this app. <br><br>
